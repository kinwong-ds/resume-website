      - Currently implementing a Large Language Model (LLM) for medical contract rate extraction to prevent rate mismatches.
      - Created an AI/ML pipeline utilizing healthcare data to reduce 30% of claims in post-pay claim inventory with an increase of 20% true positive rate, reducing auditor needs by 2 across 3 platforms.
      - Optimized claim audit prioritization with healthcare data and saved over $144K annually by using PySpark for data cleaning, feature selection, and feature engineering in an AI/ML model pipeline.
      - Supervised a production claim tiering pipeline in Apache Airflow, accounting for $13.8M in annual savings by ensuring system performance through resolving Kubernetes errors, managing Docker image builds, and performing Spark version upgrades.
      - Collaborated with engineering and operations teams to address system performance issues and engaged with business stakeholders to provide insights and answers.
      - Developed a Streamlit dashboard for a claim tiering pipeline, leveraged by leadership to track KPIs and key metrics like feature drift and recovery amounts, enabling actionable insights, business decisions, and early issue detection.
